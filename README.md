# Effect Engine 2

# Development Halted

Since I now need to work full time to support myself, this project is no longer feasible for me to complete, instead I am taking a different direction, one that I can actually manage.
I have written in some discussion posts about a Vulkan renderer that I am working on. I am still working on it, albeit slowly. Once I have it at a stage I like, the source code will become public.
I am currently rewriting a lot of old code in the renderer, as I am revisiting it after a time, and a lot of the code was based on vkguide, and have since learned better ways of doing things in Vulkan and C++.
Don't expect anything soon, if ever, but I am hoping I will have something to show eventually, it is just really hard to juggle with full time work and other hobbies.
