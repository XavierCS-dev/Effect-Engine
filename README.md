- [ ] Hide layer2d variations from user to avoid exposing implementation details.
  - [ ] Write async parallel functions to provide fast way of setting all layers.
  - [ ] Replace Context2D with EffectEvent
- [ ] ~~Implement Vulkan Renderer~~
  - This will happen much later, when the Rust ecosystem allows,
  or I will write the renderer with C then FFI with Rust
- [ ] Implement examples
- [ ] Move background to engine
 - [ ] Create an entity builder for each API
  - [ ] Rename entity2D to WebEntity2D
  - [ ] Vulkan entity2D would be VKEntiy2D
